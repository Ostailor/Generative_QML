# QAL Gate Review (T4.5)

## Summary
- **Architecture (T4.1)**: Completed with documented APIs and sequence diagrams.
- **Acquisition Benchmarks (T4.2)**: Strategies evaluated; expected improvement selected.
- **Orchestration Mock (T4.3)**: Pipeline tested with DFT handoff loop; 9/10 simulated DFT completions.
- **Label Efficiency (T4.4)**: Simulated loop achieves 32% reduction vs classical baseline.

## Decision
- **Status**: Go for DFT integration.
- **Risks**:
  - Real DFT latency may reduce throughput; mitigation: queue management.
  - Quantum kernels require hardware calibration updates (coordinate with QHSOA).

## Action Items
1. Implement asynchronous DFT submission (ALOA, MDIA).
2. Integrate real acquisition metrics into orchestrator (ALOA).
3. Prepare monitoring dashboard for label-efficiency and DFT status (RKMA).
