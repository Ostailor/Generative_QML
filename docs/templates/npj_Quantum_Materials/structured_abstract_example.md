# Structured Abstract Example â€” npj Quantum Materials

**Background**: Introduce need for quantum-enhanced active learning in materials discovery and challenges in HEA design.

**Results**: Summarize key quantitative outcomes (label-efficiency gains, accuracy metrics, generative novelty, hardware execution).

**Conclusions**: Highlight impact on cost-efficient high-strength materials discovery and implications for industrial adoption.

**Methods**: Briefly describe QAL pipeline components (QSVR/QGPR, quantum generative models, DFT integration, hardware benchmarking).
