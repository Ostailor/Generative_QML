# Venue Template Bundle

This bundle collects manuscript and submission assets for the targeted dissemination venues identified in `docs/venue_target_brief.md`.

## Structure
- `IEEE_QCE/` — IEEE conference LaTeX + Word templates, checklist, and figure guidelines.
- `MRS_Spring/` — MRS proceedings templates, color profile specs, and impact statement guidance.
- `npj_Quantum_Materials/` — Nature portfolio article templates, structured abstract example, and data availability boilerplate.

RKMA maintains this directory; updates require PDA approval (per workspace governance).
