# Impact Statement Template — MRS Spring Meeting

1. **Problem Statement**: Summarize gaps in quantum-enhanced materials discovery (2–3 sentences).
2. **Approach**: Describe QAL pipeline components (quantum kernels, generative models, DFT feedback) and novelty.
3. **Results**: Highlight improvements in label-efficiency, predictive accuracy, and generative novelty.
4. **Implications**: Discuss potential for accelerated HEA discovery and industrial impact.
5. **Future Work**: Outline roadmap toward experimental validation or expanded materials classes.
