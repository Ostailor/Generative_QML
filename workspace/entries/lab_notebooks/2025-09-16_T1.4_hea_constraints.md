## Objective
Create HEA constraint library capturing composition rules, phase heuristics, and property bounds, and deliver validation tooling for generative outputs (T1.4).

## Activities
1. Derived element set and statistical bounds from `hea_features.parquet` (30 unique elements; 3â€“9 element compositions).
2. Authored `data/metadata/hea_constraints.yaml` specifying allowed elements, atomic fraction ranges, phase/domain rules, and property bounds.
3. Implemented `scripts/validate_hea_constraints.py` to check datasets against the library; generated validation report `hea_constraints_validation.json` with 100% pass rate on processed data.
4. Logged artefacts via MLflow run `fac3c41d70024663985572723828e170`.

## Results
- Constraint library ready for integration with generative filtering and QA.
- Validation script ensures future datasets conform; report archived under QA metadata.

## Next Steps
- Integrate validation script into generative workflow (QGMA tasks) and CI.
- Update submission status to approved once constraint checks are enforced in pipeline.
