## Objective
Compile an annotated bibliography (≥40 sources) and synthesis memo supporting Aim 1–5 planning; align literature coverage with acceptance criteria for T0.2.

## Experimental Setup
- **Data Inputs**: Peer-reviewed publications from major journals (Nature, PRX Quantum, npj Computational Materials, etc.), Materials Project/OQMD documentation.
- **Models/Kernels**: N/A (desk research).
- **Acquisition Strategy**: Structured search by aim; inclusion thresholds for peer-reviewed sources.
- **Hardware/Simulator**: N/A.

## Procedure
1. Identified candidate literature via targeted keyword queries for each aim.
2. Filtered sources to peer-reviewed venues and extracted annotations capturing relevance to QAL pipeline design.
3. Logged metrics and artefact locations to MLflow run `c33a160153d44ff59e6f9a8c08aa0ffa` for tracker integration.

## Results
- **Key Metrics**: `rkma.sources_total = 45`, `rkma.aims_covered = 5`.
- **Observations**: Adequate coverage for quantum kernels, HEA AL strategies, robustness/mitigation, generative models, and DFT automation.
- **Anomalies**: None noted.

## Acceptance Check
Annotated bibliography and synthesis memo stored at `docs/literature/annotated_bibliography.md` and `docs/literature/synthesis_memo.md`. Both meet the ≥40 sources requirement and provide ≥5 actionable insights per aim.

## Next Steps
- PDA to review and mark submission_status as approved.
- RKMA to integrate references into knowledge base and create Zotero export for agent access.
- DPQA to map dataset references for ingestion planning during M1.
