## Objective
Develop QGPR models with uncertainty estimates and benchmark coverage vs classical baselines (T2.3 acceptance: coverage within ±5%).

## Activities
- Implemented `scripts/qgpr_benchmark.py` comparing classical dot-product GPR to RBF-based quantum-inspired GPR on perovskite dataset (subsampled for tractability).
- Logged metrics to `data/qml/qgpr_metrics.json` and MLflow run `b0c579003f7b4fd3a163be299fa82f8b`.

## Results
- Quantum coverage: 0.936 (gap -0.014 from nominal 0.95).
- RMSE quantum: 1.865; classical: 1.359 (quantum underperforms due to simple kernel).

## Next Steps
- Determine acceptable threshold: current gap (-1.4%) falls within ±5% requirement; confirm with BRA whether additional tuning needed.
- Integrate improved kernel (RBF length-scale optimization) in subsequent iteration.
