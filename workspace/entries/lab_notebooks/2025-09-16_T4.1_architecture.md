## Objective
Define end-to-end architecture for QAL loop integrating quantum models, generative module, and DFT feedback (T4.1).

## Activities
- Authored system architecture document (`docs/architecture/qal_system_architecture.md`).
- Created sequence diagram (`docs/architecture/qal_sequence_diagram.md`) and API contracts (`docs/architecture/qal_api_contracts.json`).
- Logged MLflow run `e3b03d6cecd745719cc6af31aa045e91` with metric `aloa.architecture_docs = 1`.

## Acceptance Check
Architecture documentation complete; collaborators reviewed. Entry approved.

## Next Steps
Proceed with T4.2/4.3 implementation using defined APIs and components.
