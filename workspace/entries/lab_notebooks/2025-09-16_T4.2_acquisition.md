## Objective
Benchmark acquisition strategies (random, uncertainty, expected improvement) to inform quantum-active-learning loop design (T4.2).

## Activities
- Implemented `scripts/acquisition_experiments.py` to simulate label-efficiency trajectories.
- Generated metrics (`data/architecture/acquisition_metrics.json`) comparing strategies over 10 iterations.
- Logged MLflow run `37a2c99fb51846cb8564cac60c55aeee` with metric `aloa.acquisition_runs = 1`.

## Results
- Expected improvement yields mean label-efficiency gain â‰ˆ0.25, uncertainty sampling similar, random baseline lower.
- RMSE histories show consistent convergence across strategies.

## Acceptance Check
Acquisition strategies benchmarked and documented; acceptance criterion satisfied.

## Next Steps
Integrate chosen strategies into orchestration pipeline (T4.3) and contrast with quantum acquisition functions in future work.
