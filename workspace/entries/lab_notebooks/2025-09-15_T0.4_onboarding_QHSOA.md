## Objective
Confirm QHSOA onboarding by mapping hardware compliance documentation to venue template requirements using the shared workspace structure.

## Experimental Setup
- **Data Inputs**: Hardware calibration log outline, cost tracking spreadsheet draft.
- **Models/Kernels**: N/A.
- **Acquisition Strategy**: N/A.
- **Hardware/Simulator**: IonQ/Quantinuum placeholders.

## Procedure
1. Reviewed `docs/templates/IEEE_QCE/graphics_guidelines.md` and `docs/templates/npj_Quantum_Materials/data_availability_boilerplate.md` to understand hardware reporting expectations.
2. Drafted checklist for including backend identifiers, calibration data, and cost metrics in future entries.
3. Verified metadata schema fields and MLflow linkage within the lab notebook template.

## Results
- **Key Metrics**: N/A (onboarding rehearsal).
- **Observations**: Template supports recording backend, cost, and mitigation data for later milestones.
- **Anomalies**: None.

## Acceptance Check
Entry references T0.4 MLflow validation run and fulfills onboarding validation for QHSOA by documenting template usage and hardware reporting plan.

## Next Steps
- Populate hardware calibration data during M6 tasks.
- Develop cost dashboard aligned with venue reproducibility requirements.
