## Objective
Evaluate quantum generative architecture candidates (QVAE, QGAN, Data re-uploading VQC) and select primary path for T3 milestones.

## Activities
- Created architecture evaluation matrix (`docs/qml/qgma_architecture_evaluation.md`).
- Logged candidate metrics in `data/qml/generative_architectures.json`.
- Recorded MLflow run `a7fb941b5d1e462790587fb6560bca70` with `qgma.architecture_variants = 3`.

## Decision
- Primary architecture: **QGAN** (highest expressivity, acceptable resource profile).
- Secondary fallback: Data re-uploading VQC.

## Acceptance Check
Evaluation includes â‰¥3 variants with documented metrics; criterion satisfied.

## Next Steps
Implement QGAN prototype during T3.2 leveraging HEA constraints and active learning integration.
