## Objective
Archive generative experiments with full provenance and ensure RKMA documentation completeness (T3.5).

## Activities
- Compiled artefact summary (`docs/qml/generative_provenance.md`) covering T3.1â€“T3.4 runs.
- Serialized provenance graph (`data/qml/generative_provenance.json`).
- Logged MLflow run `7b1278f3aae649d19b7b95c7852a52e4` with metric `rkma.generative_provenance_entries = 1`.

## Acceptance Check
Provenance entries recorded; lab entry approved by RKMA/PDA.

## Next Steps
Maintain artefact archive as additional generative experiments are executed.
