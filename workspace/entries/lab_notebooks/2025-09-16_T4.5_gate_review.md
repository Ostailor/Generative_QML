## Objective
Conduct gate review to approve transition into DFT-integrated QAL loop (T4.5).

## Activities
- Compiled gate review memo (`docs/architecture/qal_gate_review.md`) summarizing readiness.
- Logged MLflow run `693f339983c84091844704da145a96b4` with metric `pda.gate_decisions = 1`.

## Decision
- Status: **GO** for DFT integration.
- Risks: DFT throughput, hardware calibration.
- Action Items: Implement async DFT queue, integrate acquisition metrics, set up monitoring dashboard.

## Acceptance Check
Gate review documented; acceptance criterion satisfied. Entry approved.

## Next Steps
Track action items during DFT integration (T5.x).
