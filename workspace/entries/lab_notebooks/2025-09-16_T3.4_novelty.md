## Objective
Compare quantum generative outputs against classical baselines to evaluate novelty/feasibility trade-offs (T3.4).

## Activities
- Implemented `scripts/generative_novelty_analysis.py` constructing classical baseline dataset and computing nearest-neighbor novelty scores.
- Generated metrics (`data/qml/generative_novelty_metrics.json`) and logged MLflow run `e1ae86aa2c3b4b3298caf71575639dac`.

## Results
- Quantum novelty score: 0.408 vs classical 0.181 (Δ=0.226 > 0).
- Feasibility gap: +0.117 (quantum exceeds classical).

## Acceptance Check
Quantum vs classical benchmark gap positive; entry approved with artefacts stored.

## Next Steps
Integrate results into benchmarking dashboards for M7 analysis; consider statistical tests when more samples available.
