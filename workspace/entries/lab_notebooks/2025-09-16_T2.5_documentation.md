## Objective
Document QSVR/QGPR experiments, consolidate provenance, and ensure lab notebook compliance (T2.5).

## Activities
- Compiled design/benchmark documentation in `docs/qml/experiment_documentation.md`.
- Generated provenance graph `data/qml/provenance_graph.json` linking dataset releases to MLflow runs (T2.1â€“T2.4).
- Logged MLflow run `296af7c422d14a15b3eef62b99e77e65` with metric `rkma.provenance_entries = 1`.

## Acceptance Check
Documentation covers QSVR/QGPR experiments; lab entry approved by PDA and RKMA. Acceptance criterion satisfied.

## Next Steps
Maintain provenance graph as future experiments are added; integrate into RKMA quarterly audits.
