## Objective
Publish Dataset v1.0 package with reproducible artefacts, checksums, and documentation to satisfy T1.6 acceptance criteria.

## Activities
- Created release directory `data/releases/dataset_v1.0/` with README, release info, and manifest.
- Computed SHA256 checksums for raw, processed, metadata, QA, and DFT handoff files (`release_manifest.json`).
- Logged MLflow run `9dddbc130bc14f78898203a176ed27fd` capturing artefacts and release metadata.

## Acceptance Check
`dpqa.release_version` recorded as `1.0.0`; release instructions and checksums available for reproducibility. Lab entry approved.

## Next Steps
- Provide archive/DOI upload if required by venue policies.
