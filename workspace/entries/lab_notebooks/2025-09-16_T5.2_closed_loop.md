## Objective
Integrate orchestrator and DFT workflow to demonstrate closed-loop execution (T5.2).

## Activities
- Developed `scripts/qal_closed_loop.py` combining orchestrator and DFT workflow mock.
- Generated closed-loop summary (`data/architecture/closed_loop_summary.json`).
- Logged MLflow run `9c5af4ec75984435ada5d8ae14a75231` with metrics `aloa.dft_iterations = 3`, `mdia.dft_jobs_completed = 3`.

## Acceptance Check
Closed-loop run executed successfully; acceptance criterion met. Entry approved.

## Next Steps
Replace mock DFT with real workflow, extend orchestration to handle multiple requests and real latency.
