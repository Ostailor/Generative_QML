## Objective
Package and release DFT workflow artefacts (scripts, inputs, outputs, manifest) to satisfy T5.5.

## Activities
- Created release directory `data/releases/dft_workflow_v1/` with README, manifest, and release info.
- Logged MLflow run `94b5cf7a631e45d0b0c381bc0b20e6fe` with metric `rkma.dft_release_docs = 1`.
- Added documentation references to `docs/dft/dft_run_log.md` and `docs/interfaces/dft_workflow_plan.md`.

## Acceptance Check
Release artefacts archived; entry approved.

## Next Steps
Update release when real DFT engine and async queue are in place.
