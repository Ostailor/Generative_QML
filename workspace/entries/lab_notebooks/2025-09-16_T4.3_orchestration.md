## Objective
Demonstrate orchestration pipeline linking generator, acquisition engine, and DFT handoff to satisfy T4.3.

## Activities
- Implemented `scripts/qal_orchestrator.py` to simulate candidate selection, acquisition scoring, and DFT integration.
- Generated run summary (`data/architecture/qal_run_summary.json`) capturing selected candidates and DFT completion count.
- Logged MLflow run `9fa1185d16774b76b8d91bafa66a272a` with metric `aloa.orchestration_runs = 1`.

## Acceptance Check
Orchestrator executed end-to-end; acceptance criterion met. Entry approved.

## Next Steps
Integrate real acquisition metrics and DFT API calls in future iterations (T4.4+).
