## Objective
Demonstrate MDIA onboarding by outlining DFT documentation requirements using the shared workspace template and referencing venue-specific appendices.

## Experimental Setup
- **Data Inputs**: Placeholder HEA dataset (notional), DFT automation scripts (planned).
- **Models/Kernels**: N/A.
- **Acquisition Strategy**: N/A.
- **Hardware/Simulator**: Planned Quantum ESPRESSO workflows.

## Procedure
1. Reviewed `docs/templates/MRS_Spring/impact_statement_template.md` for DFT reporting requirements.
2. Drafted outline of DFT workflow documentation to align with MRS supplementary expectations.
3. Confirmed metadata schema compliance within the lab notebook template.

## Results
- **Key Metrics**: N/A (onboarding rehearsal).
- **Observations**: Template accommodates DFT-specific metadata and references to automation scripts.
- **Anomalies**: None.

## Acceptance Check
Entry recorded with required metadata fields and linked to T0.4 validation MLflow run, fulfilling onboarding requirement for MDIA.

## Next Steps
- Populate actual DFT workflow details during M5 tasks.
- Coordinate with RKMA on data deposition formats mandated by target venues.
