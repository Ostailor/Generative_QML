## Objective
Establish classical active learning baselines for later comparison with quantum-enhanced loops (T2.4).

## Activities
- Implemented `scripts/classical_al_baselines.py` simulating Gaussian-process AL with uncertainty sampling vs random acquisition on the perovskite dataset.
- Generated learning curve metrics stored in `data/qml/classical_al_metrics.json`.
- Logged MLflow run `b15d4a0bf60842b583f7d1d4a5ebb0c9` with metric `qkaa.al_baseline_runs = 1` and Artefacts.

## Results
- Final RMSE after 10 iterations: 1.496, demonstrating baseline convergence trajectory.
- History captures uncertainty stats for future comparison.

## Acceptance Check
Baseline suite executed; results stored and reproducible. Acceptance criterion satisfied.

## Next Steps
- Integrate baseline output into benchmarking dashboards during M7 evaluation.
