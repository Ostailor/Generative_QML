## Objective
Document performance gains from DFT-integrated QAL loop versus simulator-only baseline (T5.4).

## Activities
- Computed performance metrics via `scripts/performance_analysis.py` producing `data/architecture/performance_metrics.json`.
- Logged MLflow run `8e3327c30a7041dda3114a43421d133b` including `bra.performance_p_value = 0.031`.

## Acceptance Check
p-value < 0.05 confirming significant gains; entry approved.

## Next Steps
Feed metrics into benchmarking dashboards and expand statistical testing with additional runs.
