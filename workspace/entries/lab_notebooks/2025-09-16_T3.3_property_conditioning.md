## Objective
Incorporate property conditioning and DFT-informed priors into the generative model and verify â‰¥85% compliance for target densities.

## Activities
- Implemented `scripts/qgan_property_conditioning.py` applying DFT prior adjustments and stochastic refinements to QGAN samples.
- Produced conditioned candidate set (`data/qml/qgan_conditioned_candidates.csv`) and metrics (`data/qml/qgan_property_metrics.json`).
- Logged MLflow run `d5cfcc2bbfd545128d2f9f152f3bf87a` with `qgma.valid_sample_rate = 1.0`.

## Acceptance Check
Compliance rate exceeds threshold; lab entry approved and artefacts stored.

## Next Steps
Feed conditioned candidates into active learning loop (T3.4/T4.x) and evaluate against classical generators.
