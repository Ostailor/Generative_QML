## Objective
Prototype property-conditioned QGAN generating HEA compositions and verify acceptance rate â‰¥85% against constraint library.

## Activities
- Developed `scripts/qgan_prototype.py` utilizing HEA constraints and simulated density conditioning.
- Generated 120 candidates (`data/qml/qgan_candidates.csv`), computed metrics (`data/qml/qgan_metrics.json`).
- Logged MLflow run `403b23131c4b4ac59359160a55f82a69` with `qgma.valid_sample_rate = 0.883`.

## Acceptance Check
Acceptance rate exceeds 85% threshold; documentation and artefacts stored. Entry approved.

## Next Steps
Integrate QGAN with active learning loop (T3.3) and evaluate against classical generators.
