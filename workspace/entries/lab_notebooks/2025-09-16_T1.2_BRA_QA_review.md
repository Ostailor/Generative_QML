## Review Scope
Evaluate QA summaries for perovskite, HEA, and SAA processed datasets; define imputation strategy and robustness stress tests for downstream tasks.

## Observations
- Perovskites: Complete coverage; minor NA entries confined to `log_band_gap` where gap <= 0.
- HEA: Significant sparsity in mechanical tests (`elongation`, `Young's modulus`, impurity contents). Data missingness is systematic by reference ID.
- SAA: Numeric columns consistent; categorical parsing of adsorption sites successful.

## Decisions
1. **Imputation Plan**
   - Use median imputation for scalar mechanical properties (`yield_strength_mpa`, `uts_mpa`, `vickers_hardness`) grouped by `phase_label` to preserve distribution differences.
   - For density-related fields, compute ratio features where both exp/calculated exist; leave missing entries flagged for later modelling with mask indicators.
   - Treat impurity contents (`oxygen_wppm`, etc.) as optional features; create binary availability flags for robustness studies.
2. **Robustness Tests**
   - During T1.3 noise simulation, include scenarios with synthetic dropout rates matching observed missingness to validate imputation resilience.
   - For perovskites, stress-test band gap transformations by injecting small positive noise into near-zero gaps to evaluate stability of `log_band_gap` feature.

## Actions
- DPQA to encode imputation masks in preprocessing script (follow-up ticket T1.2-A) and update QA summary after implementation.
- BRA to design robustness experiment templates referencing these masks for T1.3.
