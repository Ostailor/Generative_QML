## Review Notes
- Confirmed four noise scenarios align with robustness design (Gaussian perturbations, dropout, bias).
- Requested addition of CI workflow (`.github/workflows/noise_simulation.yml`) to ensure repeatable generation.
- No additional scenarios required before active learning integration; future tasks may add correlated noise as needed.
