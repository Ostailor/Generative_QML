## Decision Summary
Selected primary and secondary conference targets (IEEE QCE, MRS Spring Meeting) with npj Quantum Materials as journal contingency; documented submission requirements and compliance checklist.

## Context
- **Problem/Question**: Determine dissemination venues with compatible deadlines, formatting, and reproducibility expectations to guide downstream planning and manuscript preparation.
- **Evidence Consulted**: Recent CFPs, venue policy documents, project milestone roadmap, charter success metrics.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Focus solely on journal submission (rejected: longer timeline, reduced conference exposure).
  2. Target general AI conferences (rejected: weaker alignment with quantum materials community).

## Decision Details
- **Selected Option**: Pursue IEEE QCE 2026 (Quantum Materials & Chemistry track) as primary venue, MRS Spring Meeting 2026 as secondary, and prepare fallback plan for npj Quantum Materials.
- **Rationale**: Deadlines align with milestone roadmap; venues emphasize quantum materials and reproducibility, offering strong overlap with research aims.
- **Impacted Tasks/Milestones**: Informs M7–M9 scheduling, mandates data sharing prep (T8.x), shapes evaluation figures for BRA, and impacts QHSOA hardware reporting requirements.

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assemble template bundle (IEEE, MRS, Nature formats) | RKMA | 2025-09-25 | Open |
| Map milestone schedule to submission deadlines | PDA | 2025-09-20 | Open |
| Define figure/layout requirements per venue | BRA | 2025-10-01 | Open |
| Prepare hardware compliance statement | QHSOA | 2025-11-01 | Open |

## Risk & Mitigation
- **Deadline Compression**: Ensure Milestones M7–M9 complete before 2025-12-05; use weekly reviews to monitor drift.
- **Data Sharing Requirements**: Coordinate with DPQA and RKMA to finalize repository DOIs by M8 gate.
