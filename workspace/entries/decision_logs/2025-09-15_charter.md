## Decision Summary
Approved the M0 research charter establishing project scope, success metrics, milestone gate criteria, governance cadence, and initial risk register for the Generative Quantum Machine Learning materials discovery program.

## Context
- **Problem/Question**: Define clear boundaries, objectives, and governance for the quantum-active-learning research initiative prior to launching data and modeling workstreams.
- **Evidence Consulted**: Project brief, `AGENTS.md`, `TASKS.md`, quantum materials literature survey outline, preliminary scheduling constraints.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Minimal charter focused only on scope (rejected due to insufficient guidance for later milestones).
  2. Deferring risk identification to M1 (rejected because gating decisions require early visibility of QPU/DFT risks).

## Decision Details
- **Selected Option**: Adopt comprehensive charter documented in `docs/m0_charter.md`, including risk register R1–R6 and explicit success metrics aligned with acceptance criteria.
- **Rationale**: Provides unambiguous alignment for all agents, links milestones to measurable exit gates, and codifies governance/ tooling assumptions needed before dataset work begins.
- **Impacted Tasks/Milestones**: Unlocks T0.2–T0.4, establishes criteria for all downstream milestones (M1–M9), informs risk monitoring cadence.

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Circulate charter to agent leads for acknowledgement | PDA | 2025-09-17 | Completed |
| Log charter reference in weekly sync notes | RKMA | 2025-09-18 | Open |
| Update risk register entries with mitigation owners in workspace | PDA | 2025-09-19 | Open |

## Risk & Mitigation
- Risk entries R1–R6 recorded in charter. PDA to monitor scheduling risks; RKMA to validate documentation compliance during weekly audits.
